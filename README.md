# Wireframing

Wireframing is the process of creating a simple visual layout that outlines the basic structure and elements of a webpage or application.
It focuses on placement, navigation, and user flow—without including colors, images, or final design details.

# Importance in the Design Process

- Clarifies ideas: Helps visualize how users will interact with the system before development.
- Saves time and cost: Identifies design issues early, reducing later revisions.
- Improves communication: Ensures designers, developers, and stakeholders share a clear understanding of the interface.
- Guides UI/UX design: Serves as a blueprint for creating detailed mockups and prototypes.

# Key Elements of a Wireframe

A wireframe consists of several important elements that define how a user interacts with the interface.
Below are the four key elements and how each contributes to the overall design:

1. Layout Structure: Defines the arrangement of sections on a page (header, sidebar, main content, footer).

- Example: Placing the booking form at the center of the homepage ensures it’s immediately visible to users.
- Contribution: Creates a logical, balanced, and user-friendly page layout.

2. Navigation: Represents how users move between pages or sections of the application.

- Example: A top navigation bar with links such as Home, Bookings, and Profile.
- Contribution: Improves usability by helping users explore the system easily.

3. Content Placement: Determines where text, images, and buttons appear on the page.

- Example: Displaying filters on the left and search results on the right in a booking app.
- Contribution: Enhances readability and ensures users find key information quickly.

4. Functionality: Refers to interactive elements like buttons, forms, and dropdowns that allow user actions.

- Example: A “Book Now” button that opens a booking form when clicked.
- Contribution: Makes the interface dynamic and supports essential user goals.

# Types of Wireframes

## Low-Fidelity vs High-Fidelity Wireframes

### What’s the difference?

Low-fidelity wireframes are simple, quick sketches that focus on layout, structure, and basic navigation—often done in greyscale with placeholder text/images. 

High-fidelity wireframes are detailed and polished, including real or realistic content, color, typography, and sometimes interactivity, closely resembling the final product. 


## When to use each?

Use low-fidelity in early design stages: brainstorming, gathering stakeholder input, iterating layouts fast, without getting stuck on visuals. 

Use high-fidelity later: refining design, finalising UI details, conducting usability testing or handing off to development. 

### Key comparative points

1. Level of detail: low-fi = minimal visuals; high-fi = full visuals and branding. 
2. Speed & cost: low-fi = fast/cheap; high-fi = slower/more costly. 
3. Purpose: low-fi = test ideas and flow; high-fi = validate design and prepare for build. 

### Which Type of Wireframe is the Linked Design?

For the design in the given link:

- It shows actual branding, styled UI elements, realistic imagery and typography rather than plain placeholders (based on typical Figma designs of that nature).
- These characteristics suggest it is high-fidelity: it looks close to a final visual design rather than a rough layout.

Therefore, under the context of the details above:

- It is not a low-fidelity wireframe.
- It would be classified as a high-fidelity wireframe (or possibly a mock-up) because of the design detail.

# Popular Wireframing Tools

There are several tools designers use to create wireframes efficiently. These tools help visualize layouts, test user flows, and collaborate with teams in real time.

## Common Wireframing Tools

- Figma – A web-based design tool used for wireframing, prototyping, and interface design.
- Adobe XD – Great for interactive prototypes and UI design.
- Balsamiq – Ideal for quick, low-fidelity sketches that look hand-drawn.
- Sketch – A macOS app for creating detailed, high-fidelity wireframes and UI mockups.
- Draw.io – A simple tool for diagrams and low-fidelity wireframes.

## Why Figma is Recommended

- Collaborative: Multiple team members can work on the same design in real time.
- Browser-Based: No installation needed — works directly from any device with internet access.
- All-in-One: Supports wireframing, prototyping, UI design, and feedback in one workspace.
- Component Reuse: Allows you to build reusable elements for consistent design.
- Version Control: Automatically saves progress, making it easy to track changes.

# Benefits of Wireframing in Software Development

- Wireframing helps teams plan and visualize a system before development starts.
- Guides Design: Shows layout and flow early, making it easy to adjust before coding.
- Example: A booking page wireframe shows where the form, search bar, and buttons go.
- Improves Communication: Gives designers, developers, and stakeholders a shared visual guide.
- Example: Everyone can agree on structure and functionality before work begins.
- Saves Time: Detects design issues early, reducing rework during development.

# Real-World Scenario: Wireframing in Action

- In a hotel booking app project, the initial wireframe showed the checkout button placed at the bottom of a long page. During review, testers found that users often missed the button, causing confusion and incomplete bookings.
- By adjusting the wireframe, the team moved the button closer to the booking summary, improving visibility and user flow. When developed, this change increased successful checkouts and reduced user frustration.

## Conclusion
Wireframing helps uncover usability issues early, saving time and cost. It ensures that designs are clear, functional, and user-friendly before a single line of code is written.
